# What is this?
⦿ A prototype/attempt of my character homescreen system, inspired by dormitory systems in gacha games.

    <p><em>Girls Frontline Dorm Screen</em></p>
</div>

A school project which requires the usage of the following:
- Components
- Props  
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React

    <p><em>Here was the rough idea for it</em></p>
</div>

# Features:
- Randomizes character display and the number of characters to be displayed (1-11)
- Character movement (every 0.8-1.2 seconds)
- Draggable character bubbles
- Explanation button
- Character redraw button
- Character count
- Lightweight transition on redraw

# Nitpicks:
- Display size is fixed and non-responsive
    - For desktop screens, I experimented too much with rigid sizing
    - For mobile screens, you may notice that dragging characters is limited to Viewport/2, issue is that the screen size is not exactly Viewport/2, it's a custom dimension.
- The vertical collision of characters just keep changing in my end so it may be inconsistent.
- Probably should have used canvas instead of divs
- No collision checks between characters
- The rarity is just for fluff, it's not weighted
- Supposedly this was supposed to be just a horizontal movement check but that would just cause 11 characters stacking on each other
- Transition via the redraw button fires twice because of React Strict mode
- I genuinely don't know why the sidebar colors mismatch the navigation bar, it's the same variable. And no it's not because of the blur filter.
- The characters aren't actually props, those are data. The only props are the character count, info popup, and header buttons.
- I don't think it needs an expert to know why having a lot of online image calls as a program backbone is a bad idea. There's that and the fact that websites can be blocked under certain connections.
- Matter.js would be a great implementation here, I'll try it after submitting this in class.
